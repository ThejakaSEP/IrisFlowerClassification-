# IrisFlowerClassification-

I have used all of the below models and fit the data. 

Logistic Regression (LR)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
Support Vector Machines (SVM).


Later checked the accuracy using Stratified 10 - fold cross validation. 

And print out the evaluation of the selected best model. ( in this case SVM )
